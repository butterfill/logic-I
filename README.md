# Logic I

Slides and handouts for an introductory logic course.

Everything is copyright Stephen A. Butterfill 2013.

I don't mind sharing any of the materials here, although they aren't organised to share yet.  Let's say the license is GPL 2.0 for now; ask me if you want something different --- I haven't had time to think about it.

This is work in progress.  You would need docpad to build it.
